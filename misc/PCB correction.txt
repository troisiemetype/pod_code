Correction for the second boards :
The S/Pdif led coupled with boot button doesn't work !
Change the display backlight mosfet to an available pinout ! (GSD)
IO 39 doesn't have internal pullups, so one external must be added for TCA9534 /INT pin.
Add big decoupling capacitors on 3.3V ; there is often a reset when USB plugs / unplugs.

Add a >4.7uF capacitor between Vbat of MCP73831 and GND.
MCP73831 should be changed to 2x3 DFN for better thermal regulation. Or see if there are other solutions.
Also set a better ground plane with more vias for heat dissipation.
Beware !! Stat on MCP73831 is driven HIGH when battery is fully charged, which is VDD level, i.e. 5V usb. So there is a great risk to damage at least the input pin, or even the esp !!

Change global size and screen orientation.

Tied unused pins of TCA9534 port expander to ground !



hardware v1.0 (RP2040 stamp + ATTiny 1616 for buttons and touch wheel) :
	VBUS as been put on GPIO25, which is not an ADC. Maybe we might detect VBUS presence.
	Remove pullup for RESET button (already on RP2040 stamp) and for BOOTSEL button (not on the original Pi Pico).
