			Make a dynamic menu system

ok				done, but needs to change the basic node.

			See if there is no memory leak in MenuIem, MenuList and AudioTrackData, with malloc / free for const char* members.

ok			Listing files on drive

			Checking existing files against database.
				checking listed files still exist
wop				checking for new files
 								Problem : a directory is marked as changed only if one of its file has changed. it doesn't do it recursively.
 								So if the file system has the same arborescens as the music library, one needs to parse all of it each time.
								One way may be to use the same "database" folder system as on iPods : several folders (iPod have 50),
								where files are stored randomly on upload, so there is only those folders to check for modifications.
ok				Breaking the XML database into smaller chunks 		// each AudioTrackData object is saved as raw bytes to SD card.
			There is a dead bug (rebooting in loop) when a binary database file is empty. Integrity of those data must be checked.

wop			Create a player GUI										// lacks album art.

wop			See how to make updates automatic. 						// use last write time on folders, but it's not recursive. See above.

wop			Implementing touch wheel
				done, but needs tweaking as it's pretty instable for now.

			make the player play songs
ok				start playing.
ok				Next / previous song.
ok				Auto next song on song end
ok				display informations								// except album covers.
				compute file duration								// need a function that checks the file. Maybe use it to get tags too.
ok				add soft mute/unmute / pause/unpause
				Make audio output to several outputs (line, S/Pdif, bluetooth, etc.)
				Manage headphone amplifier

			audio buffer is not fed enough when navigating menus !
/				use an interrupt to populate audio buffer.
ok				Audio update has been switched to a task.
ok				use DMA for TFT SPI updates.
ok				use a display queue buffer for updating.

			Add the possibility to change SD card while running.
				Menu to safely remove SD card
				when SD card is removed, check for reinsertion

			Implement energy saving
				dimming screen intensity when not touched
					add a menu to set the delay
				putting to deep sleep when stopped
					same menu as above for delay

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

			I18n options : create a langage file (xml ?) for translations.

			Play something else than mp3.

wop			Give the possibility to change the color scheme.		// branch color. Already created a struct in display.
